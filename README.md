# Mi-Store-Clone
Mi-Store-Clone is a project created using React and pure CSS to replicate the look and feel of the Mi Store website. The goal of this project is to provide a demonstration of building a responsive e-commerce website using modern web technologies. While it is a clone, please note that it is not an official Mi Store website.


## Key Features:

### Product Catalog:
The website showcases a wide range of products available for purchase. Products are organized into different categories for easy navigation and browsing.

### Product Details: 
Each product listing provides detailed information about the product, including images, descriptions, pricing, and specifications. Users can get a comprehensive understanding of the product before making a purchase decision.

### Search Functionality:
 Users can utilize the search bar to find specific products based on keywords or product names. This feature enables quick and targeted searching within the product catalog.

###
Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their virtual shopping carts, allowing them to accumulate items for purchase. The shopping cart provides a summary of the selected items and their quantities.


## Technologies Used
